# world-series video charts (Remotion)

Animated charts for the Instagram video. Each chart is a Remotion **composition**: a React component plus a size, frame rate and length. Rendering one turns it into an MP4. Read `docs/video-playbook.md` section 6 first.

## First time

Copy this template to `projects/<slug>/video/`, then replace `world-series` in `package.json` and this README.

```bash
cd projects/<slug>/video
npm install
```

## Daily loop

1. **Preview** with `npm run studio`. Run `npm run studio:zones` instead to see the layout zones over every chart.
2. **Check frames**: `npx remotion still <id> out/frame.png --frame=N`. Look at mid-animation frames too, not just the last one.
3. **Render**:
   - `npm run render:all` writes every chart to `out/<id>.mp4`.
   - `npm run stills` writes each chart's last frame to `out/stills/<id>.png`.

## Shared kit

`@kit/...` imports from `shared/video-kit/src` (wired up in `remotion.config.ts` and `tsconfig.json`):
- `@kit/zones` holds `VIDEO`, `ZONES`, `HEAD` and `ZoneGuide`. Lay every chart out inside `ZONES.chart`.
- `@kit/sharpie` holds the Sharpie look (`Page`, `Ink`, `ink`, `Scrawl`, `Axes`, `INK`, ...), if the brief picks that style. Put project-specific colors and categories in this project's own `src/sharpie.tsx` (see `projects/triple-d/video/src/sharpie.tsx`).

Keep every `remotion` / `@remotion/*` package on the same exact version as the kit.

## Compositions (1080×1920, 30 fps)

| id | Storyboard card | What | Length |
|---|---|---|---|
| `world-series` | 1–12 (all) | The whole Reel, full screen: sorting machine and bins (cards 1–8), team logo zooms with name definitions (5–8), pipes to positions filled by WAR (9–10), the ranking (11–12) | 3,453 frames (1:55:03) |

Cues are in `src/timing.ts`, converted from the Sheet's Start Time and Video columns. The estimates (Ohtani's cue, card 11's ranking rows) are marked there. The data comes from `python projects/world-series/scripts/export_video_data.py` → `src/data/video.json`. One ball = 5 players, in true proportions. Every word on screen is in Graduate, the collegiate face from the logos.
